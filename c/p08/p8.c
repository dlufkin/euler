/* A program to find the largest sum of consecutive numbers in a series.
 *
 * Implemented as a double for loop within a function that takes the
 * number of consecutive digits to multiply as an argument.
 *
 * Runtime O(n). Outer for loop iterates through all numbers in the
 * series. Inner for loop runs in constant time, depends on how many
 * consecutive digits you'd like to compare.
 *
 * I hard coded the array, because the problem didn't indicate the array
 * would change. However, I left comments below on how I'd handle an
 * array that might change. I should probably move the declaration of
 * the array somewhere else in the program as it clutters the code, but
 * I'm here writing my final comment and it's late and only a handful of
 * people are ever going to see this code anyway. */
